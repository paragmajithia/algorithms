Ball count (100 Marks)
Varun is playing a very interesting game. He has some N different types of boxes.  
All boxes may have different number of balls (S1, S2, ......, Sn).  

Varun choose two random numbers F and K. K should be less than N. The game is that Varun wants to choose any K boxes out of N boxes such that total number of balls in these K selected boxes should be some multiple of F.  

At the same time, Varun wants that sum of the balls of the selected boxes should be minimum possible.



Input Format
The first line of input consist of the number of boxes, N.
Next N lines consist of the number of balls in the respective box.
Next two lines consist of the value of F and K respectively. 


Constraints
0<=N<=1000 

Output Format
Print the minimum possible total number of balls such that the condition(s) explained in the problem statement is/are satisfied. Output should be -1 if it is not possible or Invalid input.

Output
10

For above example, N is 5 ( boxes)  

Lets say K is 3( Varun has to choose any 3 boxes)  

Lets say F is 5( sum of balls in 3 selected boxes should be multiple of 5) 

Varun can choose II, III and V boxes which would give the total sum of 10 which is multiple of F i.e. 5. And 10 is the minimum possible balls possible in the above case. 

So you have to only answer the minimum possible balls (sum of the balls in the selected boxes) but the conditions given above should be satisfied.
